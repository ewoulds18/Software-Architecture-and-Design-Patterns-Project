# Software-Architecture-and-Design-Patterns-Project
## Project Overview
The project is a simple Factory Management System. An employee management system contains various features to help organize and manage employees of a company or factory. Features of a factory management system include employee management, payroll management, product management, inventory management, notifications, amongst others.
For the scope and purpose of this project, we chose to focus on three features of the factory management system: employee management, payroll management, and the notification system.
Activities that can be performed on the system include addition and removal of new employees, assignment to existing managers and carpools, updating employee information, and calculating an employee's pay, amongst other things.
