# Software-Architecture-and-Design-Patterns-Project
## Project Overview
For our project we made a simple Employee Management system that allows for a variety of features 
to help organize and keep track of employees in the system. We have implemented 3 design Patterns 
in the software to help make it more expandable down the road, for pattern we used composite, 
observer, and decorator patterns.

The application can perform a few different tasks to help keep track of employees. Firstly, 
you can add new employees to existing mangers. You can also add an existing employee to a carpool 
list as well and then you are able to retrieve the list of employees of a manager or a carpool. 
We also added a way to update an employee’s information such as their address or the pay. With the 
employee’s pay we can figure out use that to perform some operations to easily find their hourly, 
weekly, monthly and bonus pay and then finally you can remove an employee from Managers subordinate 
list if they were fired, which also removes them from any carpools they are also in.
